# Noise Pollution Sensor in AVR Assembly
## Introduction
I made a simple Noise Pollution Sensor using the [Grove Beginner Kit](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/). In this project, I utilize the kitâ€™s sound sensor module, LED module, and the serial communication capabilities of the ATmega328P to demonstrate the creation of a rudimentary I/O device using assembly. The device captures sound intensity from its surroundings and sends a warning message through serial communication.

I wrote and debugged the program in pure assembly using the MPLABX IDE.
